# 340CT_ECS_Group_Project
This is a group project for the 340CT module assignment, where we each work on a development sprint.

Great work so far on the project team. Now lets begin to show the versioning and commits to our project. 

(Adam) So I have added a new pull request. This is version 1 of the file upload to a web application using java netbeans. However, I am glad you guys made it clear now that we are in fact working toa Java Swing Application. This is no problem. I will begin working on version 2 now. 

(Adam) Version 2 had been added onto the pull request from version 1. Aaron, we will need to collaborate to integrate your functionality of File upload. Any issues we can discuss and collaborate.

(Aaron) Reviewed code from Adam of the file upload. I have now produced code to retrieve the file uploaded, back from the database. This can be found in the forks of the project. Adam, please take a look as we will soon need to come together to integrate our code.

(Adam) Myself and Aaron have now come together to integrate our chosen functionality team. We now have a functioning file upload and retrieve functionality to a local database. I feel we can integrate with Mustafa for the login of the application. 

(Mustafa) I have added version 1 of the login code, feel free to add any comments.
