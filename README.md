# 340CT_ECS_Group_Project
This is a group project for the 340CT module assignment, where we each work on a development sprint.

Great work so far on the project team. Now lets begin to show the versioning and commits to our project. 

So I have added version 1 of the file upload to a web application using java netbeans. However, I am glad you guys made it clear now that we are in fact working toa Java Swing Application. This is no problem. I will begin working on version 2 now.
